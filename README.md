# Cox_simulation_scripts

This is the code repository for the study "When it might be important to encourage using Gaussian models for feature selection tasks with time-to-event outcome".

All simulation scripts were ran in two batches on two separate dates. Please see folder [Cox_simulation_scripts_09172022_results](https://github.com/ronglu-stanford/Cox_simulation_scripts/tree/main/Cox_simulation_scripts_09172022_results) and folder [Cox_simulation_scripts_09192022_results](https://github.com/ronglu-stanford/Cox_simulation_scripts/tree/main/Cox_simulation_scripts_09192022_results).

The scripts for generating Figure 1, Supplementary Table/Figures are provided in folder [Cox_simulation_results_summary_09252022](https://github.com/ronglu-stanford/Cox_simulation_scripts/tree/main/Cox_simulation_results_summary_09252022).
